#
#  Makefile template for making your user-level test programs.  To run
#  this Makefile, use the command:
#
#      make -f Makefile.user
#
#  To use this Makefile, you first *MUST* change the "???" on the "ALL ="
#  line below to be the name of your user-level test programs.
#
#  For example, if you have only one user-level test program and the
#  source to it is all in the one source file "testusr.c", then change
#  this line to read "ALL = testusr".  The "make" command above will
#  then be able to automatically compile "testusr.c" to produce the
#  user-level program executable "testusr".
#
#  If you have multiple different (separate) user test programs, you can
#  list them all on this line, such as "ALL = testusr1 testusr2 testusr3".
#  The make command above would then automatically compile "testusr1.c" to
#  produce "testusr1", compile "testusr2.c" to produce "testusr2", and
#  compile "testusr3.c" to produce "testusr3".
#
#  In most circumstances, you should not need to modify anything else
#  in this Makefile, other than replacing the "???" as described above.
